# Modules:

## Config

The Config module defines a simple data container class that stores all the settings and options provided by the user when running the tool. It doesnâ€™t do any logic itself. it just holds values so the rest of the program can use them.

Key parts:<br>
1. c_paths: List of file or directory paths the user wants to analyze.
2. c_outputFile: Output file name (if provided with -o / --output).
3. c_includePatterns: File patterns/extensions to include (if provided with -i / --include).
4. showHelp: Flag set to true when help is used.
5. showVersion: Flag set to true when version is used.

## CLI

The CLI module is responsible for:
Reading the arguments the user provides when running the program.
Parsing those arguments and filling in a Config object with the correct values.

Key parts:<br>
1. Constructor: Stores argc and argv from main().
2. parse(): Walks through all arguments, sets flags, and records paths/options inside a Config.
3. print_help(): Displays available commands and examples.

The CLI module ensures that no matter how the user runs the program, the rest of the code has a consistent Config object to work with.
